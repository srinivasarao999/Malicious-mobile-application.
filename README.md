Malicious Mobile Application Detection

This project aims to detect malicious mobile applications using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing application features, we can classify them as either benign or potentially harmful. Leveraging Random Forest and LightGBM models, this project achieves high classification accuracy by identifying patterns in app behavior that signal potential security risks.

Features
Binary Classification: Classifies mobile applications as either benign or malicious.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Uses Random Forest and LightGBM for effective classification.
Data Preprocessing: Includes feature engineering and selection for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation: Assesses models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Dataset: Consists of application metadata, permissions, and behavior indicators.
